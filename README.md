Automatic, context-aware permission review for OpenCode. Let routine work run normally, send riskier actions to a reviewer model, and keep coding agents moving while you are away.

The plugin supports stable and V2 OpenCode permission protocols automatically. It never grants permanent `always` permission.

## Install

Install the published npm package globally with OpenCode's built-in plugin installer:

```bash
opencode plugin -g opencode-auto-permissions
```

That is the complete plugin installation. You do not need to clone this repository, install Bun, run `npm install`, choose a reviewer model, or edit plugin entries manually.

OpenCode downloads the package, detects its separate server and TUI targets, and adds `opencode-auto-permissions` to:

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for the server integration.
- `~/.config/opencode/cli.json` for the V2 TUI integration.

Quit and restart OpenCode after installation because configuration is loaded at startup. Auto Permissions automatically uses the model and variant selected by the session that requested the action. It also detects whether the server or TUI integration owns permission review, so only one reviewer handles each request.

## Configure Permissions

The recommended setup is not to set every permission to `ask`. Allow routine work in OpenCode, then use `ask` for operations where context matters. Only `ask` requests reach Auto Permissions. For example, add risk-based rules to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "bash": {
      "*": "allow",
      "rm *": "ask",
      "sudo *": "ask",
      "git push *": "ask",
      "git reset --hard*": "ask",
      "git clean -f*": "ask",
      "curl * | *sh*": "ask",
      "wget * | *sh*": "ask"
    },
    "external_directory": "ask",
    "webfetch": "allow",
    "websearch": "allow"
  }
}
```

OpenCode uses the last matching permission rule, so keep the broad `"*": "allow"` rule first and the narrower `ask` rules after it. Adapt the list to your environment: deployments, infrastructure commands, package publication, and production database tools are good candidates for contextual review.

To confirm installation, restart OpenCode and inspect both global files for the package entry. Actions resolved by `allow` or `deny` rules will not invoke the plugin; use an `ask` rule to exercise automatic review.

## Update

Install the latest published version over the existing global entry:

```bash
opencode plugin -g --force opencode-auto-permissions@latest
```

Restart OpenCode after updating. If you use an advanced options tuple, confirm that the server and TUI entries still contain the same options after the update.

## Uninstall

Remove `opencode-auto-permissions` with `opencode2 plugin remove opencode-auto-permissions`, or remove its entry from the plugin arrays in both files, then restart OpenCode:

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`

Remove only this package's entries; leave other plugins and configuration unchanged.

## How It Works

For each supported permission request, Auto Permissions combines deterministic safety rules with an isolated, one-step reviewer model:

- OpenCode handles `allow` and `deny` rules before the plugin; Auto Permissions reviews requests configured as `ask`.
- Explicit user prohibitions and clearly catastrophic root/home deletion are rejected without model review.
- Contextual risks such as `sudo`, scoped deletion, force push, deployment, credential access, and external-directory access are judged against the user's request and target scope.
- External-directory boundaries are not treated as sensitive by default: ordinary project, tool, cache, log, state, temporary, and worktree paths are approved unless the target or operation presents a concrete hazard.
- Broad boundary globs such as `/tmp/*` are not treated as the requested scope when the tool input identifies a precise target; the reviewer evaluates the actual operation and latest user request.
- The reviewer is tuned for unattended agents: it defaults to approval when an action reasonably serves the task and uses `ask` only as a last resort.
- Reviewer failures and timeouts fail closed: the request is rejected automatically and the main agent receives guidance to continue with a narrower or lower-risk step.
- Current V2 uses stateless generation, so reviews do not create sessions or appear in session history. Older runtimes use hidden reviewer sessions with no tools and deny-all permissions.
- Only a small, recent window of relevant user context is sent for review.
- Plugin-authored denial continuations are excluded from that context so an earlier verdict cannot become a self-reinforcing human instruction.

The reviewer never receives authority to execute the requested action. It always resolves the request by approving once, approving narrow matching requests for the current session, or rejecting with an actionable reason. Session approvals are held in memory by OpenCode and do not persist to later sessions.

On older runtimes, reviewer sessions are standalone and deleted after each decision or failure. Startup never deletes reviewer sessions because multiple OpenCode processes may be reviewing permissions concurrently; one process must not delete another process's active review.

Auto Permissions never asks the user to resolve a permission prompt. When the reviewer cannot safely approve, it denies and tells the coding agent why, what safer alternative to try, and to continue autonomously where possible.

Denial and failure continuations preserve the main session's selected agent, model, and variant. A permission decision does not reset the primary agent's reasoning effort.

### Session Approvals

For repeatable low-risk operations, the reviewer may choose `allow_session`. The plugin then uses OpenCode's own tool-provided `always` patterns, so future matching requests in that session bypass another model call. It never invents or broadens a permission pattern.

Code-side guardrails downgrade `allow_session` to a one-time approval when patterns are missing or broad, or when the action involves edits, external-directory boundaries, `sudo`, deletion, push, publish, deploy, credentials, destructive Git, or other non-repeatable effects. Eligible examples include narrow reads/searches and commands such as a specific `git fetch` or test invocation. Set `sessionApprovals: false` to force all model approvals to remain one-time.

When an action is rejected, Auto Permissions returns the reason to the main agent and asks it to continue with a safer alternative when possible. For example, it can target a generated subdirectory instead of a broad recursive delete, use `--force-with-lease` instead of an unrestricted force push, or inspect a deployment plan before applying it. A denial should redirect useful work rather than end the session.

## Choosing Rules

Use OpenCode's three permission outcomes deliberately:

| Rule | Use it for | Plugin behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allow` | Routine, expected work that should never wait | OpenCode runs it immediately; the reviewer is not called. |
| `ask` | Risk depends on user intent, target, or scope | Auto Permissions reviews context and replies once. |
| `deny` | Actions that must never run in your environment | OpenCode blocks it immediately; the reviewer cannot override it. |

For unattended multi-agent work, prefer `allow` for ordinary reads, edits, tests, builds, and source-control inspection. Prefer `ask` over `deny` for commands that can be legitimate in the right context. Reserve `deny` for firm organizational or personal boundaries.

Avoid an all-`ask` configuration unless you are evaluating the plugin in `shadow` mode. It adds model latency to every tool call and makes reviewer outages affect routine work.

## Configuration

The plugin tuple accepts these options:

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | Requesting session model | Optional dedicated reviewer model in `provider/model` form. |
| `variant` | Selected model's default | Optional reviewer-only model variant. Use `"low"` when supported for faster decisions. |
| `sessionApprovals` | `true` | Reuse guarded, pattern-specific approvals immediately for the current session. Set `false` for one-time approvals only. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Review timeout from 100 to 30,000 milliseconds. The default accommodates a cold reviewer startup. |
| `userMessageCount` | `8` | Recent user messages included in review context, from 1 to 20. |
| `shadow` | `false` | Evaluate and record decisions without replying to permission requests. |
| `runtime` | `"auto"` | Diagnostics override: `"auto"`, `"stable"`, or `"v2"`. Leave this on `"auto"` in normal use. |
| `debug` | `false` | Write the latest 100 privacy-minimized outcomes to a JSONL file. Use `true` for the default path or provide a file path. |

Start with `shadow: true` if you want to observe behavior before enabling automatic replies. Because options are an advanced manual configuration, edit both generated entries so the server and TUI receive identical settings.

No configuration tuple is required. To override the automatic session-model selection with a dedicated reviewer model, or to use other advanced options, replace the package string in both generated plugin entries with the same options tuple:

```json
[
  "opencode-auto-permissions",
  { "model": "cloudflare-workers-ai/@cf/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731", "variant": "none" }
]
```

Keep the entries in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and `~/.config/opencode/cli.json` synchronized. A fast, reliable model that follows JSON instructions works best; deep reasoning adds unnecessary latency for permission review. Restart OpenCode after changing either file.

With `debug: true`, diagnostics are written to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opencode/auto-permissions/decisions.jsonl` (normally `~/.local/state/opencode/auto-permissions/decisions.jsonl`). Records include action type, timing, verdict, reason, reply result, and failure category. Commands, paths, tool inputs, and conversation text are not logged.

Access to this bounded diagnostics file is deterministically allowed by the plugin so troubleshooting cannot be blocked by speculative sensitivity concerns. This exception applies only to Auto Permissions' own `decisions.jsonl` path.

Stateless V2 reviews and standalone fallback sessions keep reviewer model and variant state isolated from the main agent and its displayed reasoning level.

Concurrent identical requests share one model review. Once a narrow, non-sensitive session pattern is approved, later matching requests in the same root session are approved without another model call. Destructive operations, pushes, publishing, deployments, credential access, and broad wildcard patterns remain one-time decisions.

The plugin does not force a universal reasoning level because variant names differ by provider. Omitting `variant` uses the selected model's variant. Avoid high or maximum reasoning for permission review unless your policy requires unusually complex analysis.

## Compatibility

The compatibility baseline was acceptance-tested in the real TUI with:

- OpenCode stable `1.18.12`
- OpenCode V2 `0.0.0-beta-202608110357`

The runtime protocol is detected automatically; stable permission events are handled by the server adapter and V2 events by the TUI adapter. See the [compatibility notes](docs/COMPATIBILITY_SPIKE.md) for implementation evidence and known protocol differences.

## Development

This section is only for contributors. Users installing through `opencode plugin` do not need Bun or a repository checkout.

Development requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and Node.js 22 or later:

```bash
bun install
bun run verify
```

`verify` runs strict TypeScript checks, the test suite, a production build, and package export smoke tests. Isolated runtime launchers are also available:

```bash
bun run test:stable
bun run test:v2
```

The launchers leave normal OpenCode configuration and session data untouched. See [Testing](docs/TESTING.md) for setup and acceptance scenarios.

Contributions go through pull requests with prefixed branches. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
